In order to get the view working, a parameter should be added to the virtual machine parameters.

1. To run the project we must open the file plugin.xml where we will be able to run the plugin
2. Once we have run the project, we can now see the running configuration used. In the menu Run go to Run Configurations...
3. In the tab Arguments, in the textarea VM Arguments, paste the following:
	-Djava.library.path="${project_loc}/native" -Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true -Dsun.java2d.opengl=true
4. Run again the plugin
5. In the eclipse instance with the plugin, go to the Window menu, then Show View, in the folder Other select sv3dx
6. The new view with opengl in it should appear

The parameter must be this because we must tell the virtual machine to find the native libraries in some place, in this case the workspace/native

Note: It should run on Windows and Linux plattforms as described above
